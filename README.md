# Lavender

Lavender is a firefox browser extension that converts gendered English pronouns (e.g., he, she, herself) to gender-neutral pronouns (ze, ze, hirself).

Gender-neutral pronouns are pronouns that do not specify the gender of their referents. Often times, the gender of a person is not relevant to the message that the text carries. Moreover, not all people's gender identities are encompassed by the gender binary that the 20th-century English language imposes.

With Lavender, you can read on the internet while the pronouns on the page are converted to their gender-neutral equivalents. This also helps you to learn the English gender-neutral pronouns.

To install Lavender, click the green button that says "Clone or download" and then "Download ZIP". Open the lavender.xpi with Firefox and click install. You should now be ready to browse the internet in Lavender English and, for example, read an article about [Chelsea Manning] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_Manning) without any gender-specific pronouns being used to refer to hir.
