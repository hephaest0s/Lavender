# Lavender

[Lavender](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/lavender_english/) is a Firefox browser extension that converts gendered English pronouns (e.g., he, she, herself) to gender-neutral pronouns (e.g., ze, ze, hirself).

## Why?
Gender-neutral pronouns are pronouns that do not specify the gender of their referents. Often times, the gender of a person is not relevant to the message that the text carries. Moreover, not all people's gender identities are encompassed by the gender binary that the 20th-century English language imposes.

With Lavender, you can read on the internet while the pronouns on the page are converted to their gender-neutral equivalents. This also helps you to learn the English gender-neutral pronouns.

## How do I install?
Lavender can be installed from [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/lavender_english/).

You should then be ready to browse the internet in Lavender English and, for example, read an article about [Chelsea Manning] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_Manning) without gender-specific pronouns being used to refer to hir.
